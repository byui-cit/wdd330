        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This course is designed to give students the skills required to create
          web applications using HTML, CSS , and JavaScript. It is intended to
          help the student learn to do this without the aid of third-party
          frameworks or libraries. Because of this, the course focuses on how to
          solve larger, ill-structured business problems by designing and
          creating web applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

        <h2>Software and Resources</h2>

        <p>
          We will be using Git and Github extensively throughout this course so
          make sure you have an account. You will also want a good text editor
          installed on your computer. If you don’t have one you are already
          invested in I would recommend
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >VS Code</a
          >
          (https://code.visualstudio.com/): Free, Mac/Windows/Linux, a good
          general purpose editor with great Git support.
        </p>

        <h2>Course Structure</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This class has an unusual course design. It is designed introduce you
          to the tools, workflows, and problems common in modern Frontend
          Development. We will spend the first 9 weeks of the course in teams
          working on a project modeled off of real world projects. The goal is
          to create an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather
          than a lecturer, and your team is a source of strength instead of
          frustration. Using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript you will explore
          technologies and use them to resolve problems that arise naturally.
          You will also learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those
          same problems through creating Single Page Web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          For weeks 10-14 of the course you will further apply what you have
          learned by designing and completing a project of your choosing. This
          project will be with your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the first nine weeks your time will be spent on a weekly
          reading assignment, a weekly Team activity, and additional tasks
          (found in a Trello board of which each team will make a copy) that add
          more functionality to our site. Each person in the team should have a
          goal of completing at least one card (task) per week.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reading assignment: 1-2hrs</li>
          <li>
            Team activity: ~2hrs (If face-to-face 1hr of this will be classtime)
          </li>
          <li>Trello Cards: ~3hrs</li>
          <li>
            Professor led instruction: ~1-1.5hrs (either scheduled class or a
            weekly recorded office hour if online)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          By taking advantage of the opportunities this course presents, you
          will develop fundamental knowledge and skills in computing and
          technology and improve your professional possibilities by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Becoming more efficient at applying your innate curiosity and
            creativity,
          </li>
          <li>becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment,</li>
          <li>
            becoming a person who enjoys helping and learning from others,
          </li>
          <li>
            using a divide and conquer approach to design solutions for
            programming problems,
          </li>
          <li>
            finding and trouble shooting bugs you and others will have in the
            code you write, and
          </li>
          <li>
            developing and debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programs that use
            medium complexity web technologies.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These outcomes support both the
          <a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >CIT Department and BYU-Idaho student learning outcomes</a
          >. The activities and assessments for this course are designed to give
          you opportunities to achieve these outcomes and evaluate you against
          them. If you desire a different set of evaluations and assignments,
          you may propose them to the instructor (during the first or second
          week of the semester) but your proposal must cover ALL of the course's
          outcomes in significant ways and to a significant depth. Do not
          propose a "check list" of do-once-and-forget activities. These will
          not be approved.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <p>
          Each week you will work directly with your team. You help your team
          become successful if you come prepared for these team meetings. This
          preparation includes thinking about the technologies you are
          exploring, completing the assignments given during the previous team
          meeting, and doing the necessary research to plan the next steps for
          your team. Just as in life, if you do more than fulfill the minimum
          requirements assigned to you, you will be more successful in your team
          and in the class. Magnify your professional calling.
        </p>

        <h3>Teach One Another:</h3>
        <p>
          Team meetings and a collaborative environment have been established to
          enable each of you to draw from the strengths of others so that your
          weaknesses can become strengths. This requires effort on the part of
          both the knower and the learner so that 'both [may be] edified' (see
          Doctrine and Covenants 50:22).
        </p>
        <h3>Ponder/Prove</h3>
        <p>
          Pondering is integral to success in both this course and life. You
          should be pondering and reflecting not only on what you are learning
          but how you are learning it. Self-understanding is vital to
          professional life. It is also fundamental to our eternal exaltation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proving is also integral to success. You should prove what you think
          you know through experimentation. Just finding an example of some
          principle on the web or from your team is insufficient for successful
          learning. You must be playing with and generating your own examples to
          understand how technologies work and what they do. This way you become
          a blessing to yourself and your current and future team members.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of each challenge, you have an opportunity for me to
          evaluate, with you, where you are in your learning and the
          accomplishment of the outcomes for the course. You must request this
          review. I will not force a review with you if you do not request one.
          You must be proactive in scheduling this evaluation. The results of
          this evaluation will not be recorded or become part of your grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>At midterm and again at the end of the semester</strong> I
          will ask you to turn in your ranking of yourself on the course
          outcomes, with a portfolio of your work to back yourself up. I
          recommend building this as you go. Your final grade will be based off
          of these two artifacts.
        </p>

        <h3>From the University Catalog:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "A" represents outstanding understanding, application, and
            integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original
            thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve
            complex problems. Demonstrates diligent application of Learning
            Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.
          </li>
          <li>
            “B” represents considerable/significant understanding, application,
            and incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to
            be successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment.
            The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the
            course.
          </li>
          <li>
            "C" represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The
            student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class.
            Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials
            might prove challenging. The student participates only marginally in
            the Learning Model.
          </li>
          <li>
            “D” represents poor performance and initiative to learn and
            understand and apply course materials. Retaking a course or
            remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction
            in this subject matter.
          </li>
          <li>"F" represents failure in the course.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Standards</h2>
