              <h3>Code Editor</h3>
              <p>
                It is important that you have a good code editor and that you
                spend some time learning how to use it. For this course it is
                recommended that you use the
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"
                  >VS Code</a
                >
                editor. Download and install it now if you do not have it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would also recommend reviewing
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank"
                  >the documentation</a
                >
                if you have not.

                We will be using materials from SitePoint.com
                (http://sitepoint.com). You will need access to their premier
                resources. The University has set up a special pricing for
                students of $13/semester. You must purchase an access code

                Have each member of the team install the current LTS (Long Term
                Support) version of node. Follow the instructions for your
                operating system found in this

              <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
              <p>
                Each person should also have
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"
                  >Git installed</a
                >

              </p>
              <p>
                You can tell whether you already have Git by opening a terminal
                (Mac) or CMD prompt/Powershell (Windows) and typing
                <kbd>git --version</kbd>. If you get an error, you need to
                install it.

              <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
              <p>
                A Microsoft Team has been setup for this course, and you should
                have been added to it. Download
                <a
                  href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app"

                  >Teams</a
                >
                and sign in with your university account. You should see a team
                named <kbd>WDD330.x semester</kbd> (If it were Fall 2020, and
                you are in section 1 the name would be
                <kbd>WDD330.01 F20</kbd>). Post a message in the General channel
                indicating that you are in.

              <h3>Form a Team</h3>
              <p>
                Much of the work for the course will be done in a team. Form a
                team with 2-3 of your classmates (total team size should be
                3-4). If you have trouble finding a team talk to the instructor.
                Once your team is formed, send an email to the instructor with
                the names of the members in your team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that everyone should be in Microsoft Teams now as
                well...you could post a message there: 'Looking for team.'
              </p>
              <p>
                If you would like a private channel for your team in Microsoft
                Teams, let the instructor know in your email.
              </p>

              <h3>Trello</h3>
              <p>
                Each person should also create a free account at
                <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>. We will
                be using a Trello board to manage the team project. One person
                in the team should visit this
                <a
                  href="https://trello.com/b/LO93bmJy/sleepoutside"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Trello board</a
                >, and
                <a
                  href="https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards"
                  target="_blank"
                  >copy</a
                >
                it to their account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then that person should invite the other team members to the
                board so they can edit it.
