            We make a big deal about "Teach One Another" here. This often gets
            implemented as group work. This is not a bad thing, no matter how you
            personally may feel about it. Turns out most jobs
            <strong>will</strong> require you to work with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers often make too many assumptions however about how much our
            students know about <em>how</em> to work in a group. Here are a few
            tips and tricks to help you out with group projects.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Common Issues with Groups</h2>
        <p>
          The following are common complaints I hear from students about working
          in groups:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's too hard to coordinate schedules</li>
          <li>Not everyone in the group contributes evenly</li>
          <li>I'm never sure what I should be doing</li>
          <li>
            It's too hard to keep everyone in the group on the same page and
            doing the right thing at the right time
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Do you notice the common thread? Successful group work really comes
          down to how well you <strong>communicate</strong> with each other.
        </p>
        <p>Let me share a few tips and tools you can use to help.</p>
        <h2>Tips and Tools</h2>

        <p>
          To be honest, in a school group project, schedule coordination is
          probably the hardest thing to accomplish. In a work environment (what
          we are trying to emulate with group work), you have the advantage that
          everyone is expected to be around and somewhat available M-F, 8-5.
          That is not the case in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the only advice I can offer here is that when you are in
          a group you will have to make it a priority. Make time wherever you
          can so that you don't let your group down. But you can try and
          minimize the amount of time you all need to be together at once. Try
          to make your group function as asynchronously as you can.
        </p>
        <p>In order to do that, you will need a few things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A good way to communicate</li>
          <li>A good way of tracking and assigning tasks</li>
          <li>
            A way to avoid stepping on each others toes when working on similar
            areas of the project
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Here are a few tools that the pros use to accomplish those things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>: If there
              was one tool that most developers rely on for communication, it
              would be Slack. Slack is an online communication tool that is easy
              to setup and free to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Microsoft Teams is another great alternative. It is very similar
              Slack and all students at the University have an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              On regular intervals your group should be checking in with each
              other to give progress updates. These meetings should be very
              quick. While they would be synchronous in the ideal
              setting, they can certainly be accomplished asynchronously as
              well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Setup a Slack or Teams channel for your group and then once a day
              for short projects, or once or twice a week for longer ones, each
              member of the team should be required to check in with Slack and
              report their progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              In these meetings members usually report: What I've done since I
              last reported, what I am planning on doing next, and if I'm stuck
              on anything.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>: I'm a big
              fan of Trello for tracking tasks. This is another free tool that
              you should take advantage of in your groups. Create a board with a
              minimum of the following lists: Backlog, Defects, Doing, and Done,
              then invite all the members of your group to the board.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/trello-example.jpg"
                  alt="Example of a Trello board"
                />
                <figcaption>Example of a Trello project board.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              At the beginning of the project the group's first job is to get
              together and fill out the Backlog list. This initial list building
              REALLY needs to be done synchronously (an 'all hands on deck' meeting).
              Every single task should be broken into as small of pieces as
              makes sense, and entered in there. (A good benchmark is that most
              tasks should take less than 30 minutes to complete.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Anytime someone thinks of something else that needs to be done it
              should immediately be added to the backlog list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then whenever a member has time to work on the project, they can
              login to Trello, put their face on a card (assign the card to
              themselves), and move it into Doing. This way you can always see
              who is working on what, and what still needs to be done.
            </p>
            <p>Make sure to move your tasks to Done when you finish them!</p>
            <p>
              One really nice side effect of working this way is at the end of
              the project there is no question about who did what...or who did
              nothing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>: Every
              successful team needs a way to share what they have done with each
              other. GitHub is one popular way to do that (<a
                href="https://bitbucket.org"
                target="_blank"
                >Bitbucket</a
              >
              is another popular alternative). These tools track changes, which
              is awesome for groups. They do take a bit of effort to learn how
              to use effectively, but it is totally worth it! If you do a search
              you will find many free resources to help you master them. (Two
              topics to give special attention to would be merging conflicts and
              ignoring files.)
            </p>
            <p>
              One other suggestion for managing code would be to break it down
              into small pieces. Spread your code across many small files with
              each accomplishing one thing, instead of trying to get everything
              together in one large, hard to maintain file. This also helps you
              to avoid having conflicts on committed code.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Putting it Together</h2>
        <p>
          Let's look at how this might look on any given day for a member of a
          group if you setup your project with these tools (or something
          similar):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Login to Slack or Teams and see what updates there are from team
            members.
          </li>
          <li>Open Trello and look over the Backlog and the Doing lists.</li>
          <li>Assign myself to a new task and move it to Doing.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure to "Pull" from the code repository (either GitHub or
            Bitbucket) to get any changes my teammates might have finished.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open my editor and complete the Task I grabbed. (Complete means
            coded AND tested! Make sure you didn't break anything with your
            changes!)
          </li>
          <li>
            "Commit" and "Push" my code back up to the Repository for my
            teammates.
          </li>
          <li>Move the task I just finished in Trello over to Done.</li>
          <li>
            Make any updates to Slack or Teams that your group might need to
            know about what you did.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
        <p>
          I should finish by saying two things: first, these tips and tools will
          make the biggest difference in group projects that must be completed
          and turned in as a group, but they can also be applied with success in
          learning groups. Second, these are not the only tools available to
          solve these problems...and none of them are required to use. But
          adopting them or something like them in your group project workflows
          can make a huge difference on your success and enjoyment in working in
          groups!
