        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Now that our users can places orders...we need to create a way for our
          staff to review and process those orders. This week we will add a
          simple Administrative portion of our site. This portion of the site
          should only be accessed by authenticated users.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team8: Authentication" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read the
                details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team8</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team8</code>
              </p>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Setup our Customer orders and login</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new directory in the src directory called
                <kbd>orders</kbd>. Add an <kbd>index.html</kbd> and add the
                basic HTML we need as well as add the header and footer of the
                site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create another new directory in the src directory called
                <kbd>login</kbd>. Add an <kbd>index.html</kbd> and add the basic
                HTML we need as well as add the header and footer of the site.
                Then create a login form that will ask for an email (username),
                and a password.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Remember to update your <kbd>vite.config.js</kbd>!
              </p>
              <p>
                Create an <kbd>orders.js</kbd> file and a
                <kbd>currentOrders.mjs</kbd> module as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                This page will eventually show a list of current orders. This is
                information that we don't want everyone to see. It should be
                protected by a login.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create as well a <kbd>login.js</kbd> file. This file should do
                the following:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Load the header and footer onto the page.</li>
                <li>
                  Check for a url parameter called <kbd>redirect</kbd> (remember
                  the utility function: <code>getParam</code>?)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add an event listener to our login form's button, when the
                  login button is clicked do the following:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Get the username and password out of the form fields.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pass those to the <code>login</code> function along with
                      the redirect information we gathered above.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>

              <!-- END STEP -->

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>The auth module</h3>

              <p>
                Create an <kbd>auth.mjs</kbd> module. Add three initial
                functions: <code>login</code>, <code>isTokenValid</code>, and
                <code>checkLogin</code>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>login(creds, redirect)</code> will be responsible for
                  sending the credentials to the authentication server and if
                  that comes back successful it will store the authentication
                  token that is sent back into local storage. Then we will
                  redirect the user to whatever page they were trying to access
                  when they were asked to login.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>checkLogin()</code> is responsible to check to see if
                  the user is already logged in. How will we do that? We will
                  check to see if there is a valid token stored in localStorage.
                  If there is no token, or if the token is expired we should
                  redirect the user to the login page...making sure to keep
                  track of the page they were trying to access so we can send
                  them back after the login!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>isTokenValid()</code> is responsible for checking an
                  existing token to make sure it is not expired. It should
                  return a true or false, true if the token is still valid
                  (unexpired), false if it is expired.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Logging in</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to finish our <code>login</code> method. The server
                that we need to authenticate with to retrieve the orders
                information has a login endpoint at this address:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://server-nodejs.cit.byui.edu:3000/login</code></pre>
              <p>
                We need to make a <code>POST</code> request to that address with
                the email and password the user provides as the body. Just to
                keep things consistent lets create a function in
                <kbd>externalServices</kbd> called
                <code>loginRequest(creds)</code> that will make the actual
                request to the server.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">{ email: "user1@email.com" , password: "user1" }</code></pre>
              <p>
                If our request is successful (email and password match a user in
                the database) then the server will return a token. This token
                must be provided with each additional request we make to the
                server. Save into localStorage with a key of
                <kbd>so_token</kbd>.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                If you get tired of typing <kbd>user1@email.com</kbd> you can
                add <code>value="user1@email.com"</code> to your email input
                element...and it will remember it. Just remember to remove it
                when you are done testing!
              </p>
              <p>
                To redirect to another page we can use
                <code>window.location</code>. This object contains a lot of
                information about the page that is currently loaded, and if you
                update it the browser will change to the new path. So if we
                wanted to send the user back to the homepage of the site we
                could do the following: <code>window.location = '/'</code>. You
                should take a look at <code>window.location</code>. We will be
                using it more later.
              </p>
              <p>This is how my <code>login</code> method ended up:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
import { loginRequest } from "./externalServices.mjs";
import { alertMessage, getLocalStorage, setLocalStorage } from "./utils.mjs";

const tokenKey = "so-token";
export async function login(creds, redirect = "/") {
    try {
        const token = await loginRequest(creds);
        setLocalStorage(tokenKey, token);
        // because of the default arg provided above...if no redirect is provided send them Home.
        window.location = redirect;
    } catch (err) {
        alertMessage(err.message.message);
    }
}</code></pre>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Checking for a valid login</h3>

              <p>
                After a user has logged in the token provided by the server will
                be stored in localStorage. If that token is found it means that
                the user HAS logged in at some point, but if that was too long
                ago the token will be expired and invalid. We should check
                therefore that a token exists AND that it is not expired. The
                type of token we are using as known as a Json Web Token or JWT.
                The are encoded when they are sent by the server...in order to
                check the expiration we will need to decode the token.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will need some help for this. In this case we will use some
                code written by someone else and provided as a module called
                <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode">jwt-decode</a
                >. You should probably look through the documentation to see how
                to use it! If you do you will see that to get the module we will
                use our package manager...NPM. In the terminal type the
                following:
              </p>

              <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install jwt-decode</code></pre>
              <p class="callout">
                Make sure you are in the root of your project! This is the same
                place that your <kbd>package.json</kbd> file is found and the
                same place that you would normally run the
                <kbd>npm run start</kbd> command.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the package is installed we can use it by importing it into
                our code...just like we have been doing with our own modules all
                semester!
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import jwt_decode from "jwt-decode";</code></pre>
              <p class="callout">
                All of the other tools that we installed were for use in
                development...this is the first one we have installed that we
                want to send out with our code. You will notice two sections in
                your <kbd>package.json</kbd>: "devDependencies", and
                "dependencies". The first is for development oriented tools and
                will not get packaged up with our final code. The second will
                get packaged up and sent with our production code.
              </p>
              <p>We need to do the following to check our token:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Check to make sure that something was passed into our function
                </li>
                <li>
                  If yes then:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      use the <code>jwt_decode</code> function we imported in to
                      decode the function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Get the current date using the built in
                      <code>Date()</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Compare the expiration in the token (can be found in
                      decoded.exp) with the current time. Note that the current
                      time will be in milliseconds and the expiration in the
                      token will be in seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the expiration is less than the current time the the
                      token is expired...log a note and return false
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Otherwise the token is OK and we should return true.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If no then return false</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                One note: the expiration is set to be very short on the
                development api. The token will expire in 1 minute! This is to
                allow you to easily test your code. If your group gets stuck,
                review the solution below:
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary>isTokenValid()</summary>

                <pre><code class="lang-js">
function isTokenValid(token) {
    // check to make sure a token was actually passed in.
    if (token) {
        // decode the token
        const decoded = jwt_decode(token);
        // get the current date
        let currentDate = new Date();
        // JWT exp is in seconds, the time from our current date will be milliseconds.
        if (decoded.exp * 1000 < currentDate.getTime()) {
        //token expiration has passed
        console.log("Token expired.");
        return false;
        } else {
        // token not expired
        console.log("Valid token");
        return true;
        }
        //no token...automatically return false.
    } else return false;
}
              </code></pre>
              </details>
              <p>
                Now that we can check tokens we can finish out the
                <code>checkLogin</code> function. See the list of steps.
              </p>

                <li>
                  Check the token with the <code>isTokenValid</code> function.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If not valid then:

                    <li>remove the token from localStorage</li>
                    <li>
                      Get the path of the current location. This can be found in
                      <code>window.location</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Redirect the user to the login page, sending in the
                      current path as a parameter. (An easy way to redirect is
                      to update <code>window.location = newPath</code>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If token is valid: return the token.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Also again, if your group gets stuck the solution can be found
                below. Do not just copy/paste these solutions into your code!
                Review them until you can see where you went wrong and fix it.
                You will learn much more that way!

                With <code>checkLogin</code> written all we need to do now to
                protect a page on our site is to call the function as soon as
                the page loads. If it does not find a valid token the user will
                automatically get sent to the login page, and returned to where
                they were trying to get to once logged in.

              <h3>Getting the orders</h3>
              <p>
                We are finally ready to retrieve the orders! The orders we are
                looking for can be found at
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://server-nodejs.cit.byui.edu:3000/orders</code></pre>
              <p>
                If you make a <code>GET</code> request to that address however
                you will get an error. This is a protected endpoint. We need to
                send our token along with our request so that the server knows
                we can be trusted. Tokens like this are usually included in the
                <kbd>headers</kbd> of the request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a header for our request called
                <code>Authorization</code> that will include our token. If you
                look in <kbd>externalServices->checkout</kbd> there is an
                example of using a custom header. If you decide to copy/paste
                that one, remember that we want to do a GET, which means we
                shouldn't have a <code>body</code> property.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will probably want to make a new method in
                <kbd>externalServices</kbd> to get the orders from the server.
                The line you will want to add to the
                <code>headers</code> portion of your options should look like
                this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
} </code></pre>

                mind when you do this however, and make it look good. Also...you
                probably do not want to display all of the information in the
                order. Put yourself in the shoes of someone needing to review
                and process these orders to fill them. What information would

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/v3-team8/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
