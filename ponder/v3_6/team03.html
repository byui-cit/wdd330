        <h1>Ponder: Team Activity 3</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will continue the process of making our site more
          dynamic. We will do this by addressing the home page. Eventually we
          will want to list out more products, so we need to make the product
          listing build dynamically based on provided data.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity do not look at the examples until your group
          has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example
          resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to give
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

        <div class="requirements">
          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team3: Dynamic product list" task...then move it to 'Doing'.
                Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team3</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team3</code>
              </p>

              <h3>Check Your Build</h3>
              <p>
                Last week we made some changes to the structure of our site. You
                should have had some pull requests created and merged at this
                point as well. Have you checked the "production" build of your
                site since then? Remember that we are deploying our site to
                Netlify. This deployment is actually automatic. Everytime you
                change the "main" branch of your site it will update Netlify.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can also check the production build locally. If you run
                <kbd>npm run build</kbd> it will update the files in the
                <kbd>dist</kbd> directory.
              </p>

              <p>
                Someone on the team should check the build periodically to make
                sure it is not broken. A good time to do this would be each time
                a pull request is merged!
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>

              <h3>Building Components</h3>
              <p>
                A very popular way to build web apps currently is by creating
                re-usable components. These components have all of the markup,
                styling, and functionality packaged up in an easy to use form.
                The module we made in the last activity followed this form to
                some extent. all we had to do to get a product to display with
                it's details was to call a function.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our module works, but has a few drawbacks with performance and
                implementation. Because it can be fairly difficult to solve
                those problems, and because almost everyone writing web
                applications runs into them many libraries and frameworks have
                been built to help.
              </p>
              <p>
                Part of your reading for this week was a
                <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte"
                  >tutorial on Svelte</a
                >. Svelte is a framework for creating modern web applications
                with components. We will be using it in our project starting
                with this week to help us build our re-usable components.
              </p>
              <p>
                One nice thing about Svelte components is that they are file
                based. One file for all the HTML markup, CSS, and Javascript.
                Another nice thing is that the templates are mostly just
                HTML...with some Svelte specific templating additions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to add Svelte to our project. Because we are already
                using a package manager (npm) and a bundler (Vite) this is
                really easy.
              </p>
              <p>Open the terminal in VSCode and run the following command:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm i -save-dev svelte @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte</code></pre>
              <p>
                Svelte is a little different than many other frontend frameworks
                like React, Vue, or Angular. It is actually a compiler. When you
                write a React app for example you have to send the entire React
                codebase along with your code so that it can work. Svelte runs a
                compile process instead. When it is done you don't need the
                Svelte library anymore, so you end up sending less code to the
                browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need the compiler to run each time we make a change to our
                code however so we can see the effect of our changes. Luckily
                because of the way in which our project is already setup it is
                easy to make this happen. We will need to make a couple more
                small changes however.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add the following lines to your <kbd>vite.config.js</kbd> file
                first:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import { svelte } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";</code></pre>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">export default defineConfig({
                plugins: [svelte()],
                //... the rest of the config here ...
              });</code></pre>
              <p>At the end your file should look something like below:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
import { resolve } from "path";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { svelte } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [svelte()],
    root: "src/",
    build: {
    outDir: "../dist",
    rollupOptions: {
        input: {
        main: resolve(__dirname, "src/index.html"),
        cart: resolve(__dirname, "src/cart/index.html"),
        checkout: resolve(__dirname, "src/checkout/index.html"),
        productDetail: resolve(__dirname, "src/product_pages/index.html"),
        },
    },
    },
});
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                Then create a new file in the root of your project called
                <kbd>svelte.config.js</kbd>. Add the following to that file:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'

export default {
    preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                The last change we need to make is to add the line
                <code>"type": "module",</code> into our
                <kbd>package.json</kbd> file. That's it. We can now use Svelte
                in our project!
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Once the changes from this team activity are merged back into
                  the main branch, each member of the team should pull those
                  changes and then run the command <code>npm install</code>. You
                  should only have to do this once to grab the new tools into
                  your local development environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is one more thing you will probably want to do to finish
                  your setup. There is a very nice VS Code extension for Svelte
                  that will make your life much easier. It's called "Svelte for
                  VS Code". Each member of the team should install it.
                </p>

              <h3>ProductList component</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new folder in the your project:
                <kbd>src/js/components/</kbd>. Create a new file in that
                directory called <kbd>ProductList.svelte</kbd> that we will use
                for the code to generate a list of product summary cards in HTML
                from an array. (It's common practice in most component based
                libraries to name components in this way.
                PascalCased...camelCased but capitalized).
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside the <kbd>ProductList.svelte</kbd> file we can actually
                type HTML directly. Try adding something like:
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My new product list componenent!&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                We can add our component to the page by first importing your
                component into <kbd>main.js</kbd>. We will also need a Svelte
                utility: <code>mount</code>
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import ProductList from "./components/ProductList.svelte";
import { mount } from "svelte";

const productList = mount(ProductList, {
  target: document.querySelector(".products"),
});
              </code></pre>

              <p>
                Visit the home page in the browser to make sure you see what you
                expect!
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Make sure that you add <kdb>main.js</kdb> into your index.html
                file with a script tag. Otherwise you may end up wondering why
                nothing you do has any effect! Remember that we are also using
                modules...
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that we have a basic component working, we can add the rest
                of the functionality we need. Begin creating your ProductList
                component by thinking about the information it will need to
                accomplish it's purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually we will want to have more than one category of
                products, and list each out independently. We will need to pass
                in the category of products we want. In most component based
                frameworks this is done with
                <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/declaring-props"
                  >props</a
                >
              </p>

              <p>
                Inside the component we will need to read the product data out
                of the
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file (our current data source). We did
                something similar last week. Then we only needed one product,
                this time we need all of them. If you review the contents of our
                <code>productData</code> module, you will see a function
                <code>getData</code>. Import that into the module and use it to
                get the list of products from <kbd>tents</kbd>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can add Javascript to our component with a
                <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Your code thus far might
                look like this:
              </p>

              <pre><code class="lang-js">
&lt;script&gt;
import { getData } from "../productData.mjs";

// this is how we make a prop in svelte
let {category} = $props();
// if you are looking at this thinking that's strange to just stop with a promise
// you would be right.  This will make more sense in a bit...stay tuned.
let promise = getData(category);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top products: {category}&lt;/p&gt;
                </code></pre>
              <p>
                To pass our prop into the component you will need to make a
                change in <kbd>main.js</kbd>
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
const productList = mount(ProductList, {
  target: document.querySelector(".products"),
  props: { category: "tents" },
});</code></pre>
              <p>
                Note that we can embed variables into our template using the
                curly braces. This is similar to what we have done before with
                template literal strings. We just don't need the $ in this case
                or the backticks.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Working with templating</h3>
              <p>
                As you think about how to build out our list it would be good to
                break it down into parts:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>A title identifying the component</li>
                <li>A list</li>
                <li>
                  A collection of product summary cards in the list...one for
                  each product we want to display.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                We already have examples of all of this in the current
                index.html file. Begin by copy/pasting the code inside of the
                <code>.products</code> container into your
                <kbd>ProductList</kbd> component. Since one of our goals is to
                make the list dynamic as well we should get rid of all but one
                of the <code>li</code> elements.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
&lt;script&gt;
import { getData } from "../productData.mjs";

// this is how we make a prop in svelte
let {category} = $props();
// if you are looking at this thinking that's strange to just stop with a promise
// you would be right.  This will make more sense in a bit...stay tuned.
let promise = getData(category);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Top products: {category}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="product-list"&gt;

&lt;li class="product-card"&gt;
    &lt;a href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"&gt;
        &lt;img
        src="images/tents/marmot-ajax-tent-3-person-3-season-in-pale-pumpkin-terracotta~p~880rr_01~320.jpg"
        alt="Marmot Ajax tent"/&gt;
        &lt;h3 class="card__brand"&gt;Marmot&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="card__name"&gt;Ajax Tent - 3-Person, 3-Season&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="product-card__price"&gt;$199.99&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                We are getting closer, but our component is still very static,
                and we will only have one product listed instead of however many
                are returned from the data source. A good templating tool should
                help us with things like this. In fact, Svelte does have some
                nice tools to help us with
                <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/each-blocks"
                  >looping</a
                >
                and even to handle
                <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/await-blocks"
                  >promises</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                After reviewing the links above, update your template to use an
                <code>{#await}</code> block and an <code>{#each}</code> block.

                At this point if everything is working you should see 6 copies
                of the list item. They will all be identical, but we will fix
                that next.
              </p>
              <!-- <p>
                As we think about building our product list, each product card
                will have very similar markup. Templates are a way for us to
                reuse markup in an efficient way. Last week we were able to
                leave the markup in the HTML file, and just fill in the values
                with Javascript, but that won't work this week as we need
                multiple copies of the template. There are many ways that
                developers will handle templating issues. When choosing a
                templating solution you should keep a few things in mind:
              </p> -->

              <!-- <ol>
                <li>
                  Ideally the solution will maintain the separation of concerns.
                  It would be good if we left the HTML where it belongs...in the
                  .html file instead of buried in the javascript. This leads to
                  more maintainable code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The html and css for a site is often managed by a different
                  group than the logic in the Javascript. If the HTML is in the
                  javascript then everytime a styling change needs to be made
                  the Javascript will have to be modified instead of just
                  changing the HTML. If your templating solution involves
                  embedding the HTML in the Javascript code, is it done in such
                  a way that does not require a high level of JS knowledge in
                  order to change a template?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance. Our templating solution should not lead to
                  performance issues.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Some of the options that are used can be found below:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the project is using a frontend framework or library like
                  React, Angular, Vue, Svelte,
                  <a
                    href="https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_experience_ranking"
                    >etc</a
                  >, the tool will usually have the templating solution built
                  in. You should really use the built in solution. (For more
                  information take WDD 430)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Server Side Rendering (SSR) We could use a server side
                  language like PHP, .NET, or NodeJS to insert the template when
                  the page was requested, but before it was sent. (For more
                  information take CSE 340 (PHP), CSE 341 (NodeJS), or CIT 365
                  (.NET))
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are templating solutions that become part of the
                  frontend build process. Tools like
                  <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>,
                  <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>,
                  <a href="https://pugjs.org/">pug</a>
                  <a
                    href="https://www.developerdrive.com/best-javascript-templating-engines/"
                    >etc</a
                  >. Most of these tools would be integrated into your workflow
                  through your bundler or task manager.
                </li>
                <li>

                A product summary card is also something that we might want to
                reuse in another context. It would be good to make that a
                standalone component. Create a new file called
                <kbd>ProductSummary.svelte</kbd> in the components directory and
                refactor your code to make it work. You should pass the current
                product in as a prop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that we have actual products, update the
                <code>ProductSummary</code> component to insert the correct
                variables into your template. Then test again to make sure
                everything is displaying correctly. Remember to remove the hard
                coded products in the <kbd>/index.html</kbd> file so we don't
                have any duplicates. Don't forget to insert in the product.Id
                into the href in the link!
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Remove extra products</h3>
              <p>
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> has more tents than we currently need.
                Write a method in <kbd>productList.svelte</kbd> that will filter
                our list of products to just the 4 we need. Use that method to
                show only those 4 tents.
              </p>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,

        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working the driver should commit and
          push their changes then submit a pull request for this branch. Then
          review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back
          into Main. Finally someone should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
