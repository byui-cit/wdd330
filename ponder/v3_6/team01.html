        <h1>Ponder: Team Activity 1</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will aid you in getting the project and environment
          setup for your team. It will introduce a NodeJS based workflow and
          development/build tools.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Normally the driver should be the only one entering code, the rest of
          the team should direct the driver and tell them what to write. This
          week will be an exception to that though in a couple of spots.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Each week let someone else be the
          "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be very helpful if you have completed the Github course:

          before you do this.
        </p>

          If your group is ready to start the activity and you have not had a
          chance to complete the course above...you can quickly review this

                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should visit the Team's copy of the project Trello
                  board and add each team member to the "Setup project for all
                  team members" task. Then move it to "Doing".
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make sure that you are familiar with how to use the command
                  prompt for your operating system. Here are some quickstarts

                <li>
                  The driver for this week should then log into GitHub, and
                  visit this
                  <a href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside-v3"
                    >repository</a
                  >
                  for the project. Click on the "Use this template" button to
                  create a copy of the base project code in a new repository
                  then give the new repo a name.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should then goto Settings->Manage Access and add
                  the rest of the team members as collaborators. (Each team
                  member needs to have their own GitHub account for this step.
                  Create one if you do not have one.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should then clone the repository to
                  their computer.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Finish the project setup:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Open the project in VS Code. File->Open, then select the
                  <em>directory</em> that the repository cloned into.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should then open a terminal window and
                  switch to the project directory. If you are using VS Code
                  <kbd>ctrl ~</kbd> toggles the terminal panel open and closed.
                  When you open the terminal in VS Code it will automatically be
                  set to the root of your project. Type <kbd>ls</kbd> if you are
                  on a unix based system (MacOS, Linux), or <kbd>dir</kbd> if on
                  Windows. Make sure that you see <kbd>package.json</kbd> in the
                  list of files it prints out. If not you will need to change
                  the working directory in the terminal to whatever directory
                  you put the project files in. Then type
                  <kbd>npm install</kbd>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice that a new directory was created:
                  <kbd>node_modules</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  This project comes with several tools built in to help the
                  team to write error free consistent code. The driver should
                  open up the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file. There are two
                  sections initially you should review.
                  <code>devDependencies</code>, and <code>scripts</code>.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>devDependencies</code> contains all of the tools we
                      will be using in our development for this project. When
                      you ran <kbd>npm install</kbd> earlier, it referred to
                      this list to know what to install.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>scripts</code> are shortcuts to commands we can run
                      to manage the project. It contains the following:
                      <pre><code class="lang-json">"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",
  "build": "vite build --emptyOutDir",
  "lint": "eslint *.js src/**/*.js",
  "format": "prettier --ignore-path ./.gitignore --write \"./**/*.{html,json,js,ts,css}\"",
},</code></pre>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>start</code>: This will run our development server.
                      You will use this the most.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>build</code>: This will prepare our code to be
                      deployed to production. You can run this at anytime to see
                      what the "build" version of the site looks like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>lint</code>: This will run Eslint against the code
                      to look for style and syntax errors. You should do this
                      each time you are ready to commit. Make sure to clean up
                      any errors it finds before you commit!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>format</code>: This will run Prettier on your code
                      and format it all consistently. You should also do this as
                      a step in your commit process.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The commands are run in the terminal. If you wanted to start
                    up the development server for example you would type
                    <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. If you wanted to lint your code:
                    <kbd>npm run lint</kbd>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try running the linter now. What did you see? Have the
                    driver open up the <kbd>eslint.config.js</kbd> file. You may
                    have noticed that one of the errors it is complaining about
                    is that your quotes should all be single. You might be
                    saying to yourself..."why does <em>that</em> matter?" Well,
                    the truth is that it does not really matter whether you use
                    single or double quotes in your code. What matters is that
                    the whole team is consistent in using one or the other.
                    Decide as a team whether you would like to use single or
                    double quotes. Then find the line that looks like this:
                    <code>"quotes":["error", "single"]</code> in the
                    <kbd>eslint.config.js</kbd> file. If you want single quotes
                    then make no changes. If you want double quotes then change
                    the word "single" to "double".
                  </p>
                  <p class="callout">
                    The <kbd>eslint.config.js</kbd> file belongs to the team. If
                    your team disagrees with any of the rules that are being
                    enforced, change them! Just make sure that all the team
                    members are on board with the changes. If you do decide to
                    dig into setting up custom Eslint rules you might want to
                    get the <kbd>LintLens</kbd> extension for VSCode.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next run <kbd>npm run format</kbd>. Then go and run the
                    linter again. What happened? Have the driver fix any
                    remaining errors , then commit and push the changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each member of the team should run the format AND lint
                    command BEFORE they commit after making any changes.
                  </p>
                  <p class="callout">
                    If you are using VS Code there are extensions you can
                    install that will format (Prettier) and lint (ESLint) your
                    code everytime you save! Alternatively you could take
                    advantage of npm and scripts such as
                    <a

                    to further automate these tasks

                </li>
                <li>
                  Each person in the group should try running
                  <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. This runs several processes on our
                  code and launches a web server at <code>localhost:8080</code>.
                  It should also open that address in your default browser as
                  well, if it did not you can type that address directly into a
                  browser. You should use this server as you develop your
                  project instead of something like LiveServer!
                  <p>
                    When you are done working you can stop the dev server by
                    typing <kbd>ctrl c</kbd> in the same terminal window in
                    which the process is running. That will terminate it.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should run <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. This will
                  create a directory called <kbd>dist</kbd>. Commit those
                  changes and push them to GitHub. If you goto github.com you
                  will notice that the <kbd>dist</kbd> directory did not
                  transfer with our commit. If you check the
                  <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file that is part of your project you
                  will see why.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will be using a product called
                  <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host our
                  site. One person in the group will need to create a free
                  account there and login for the next step.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After logging in you need to add a new site. Click on the "Add
                  New Site" button and select "Import an Existing Project".
                  Connect to your Github account using the "Github" button. You
                  should see a list of repositories on your account. Find the
                  one that contains the Sleepoutside project.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select the "main" branch. Then in the "build command" box
                  enter <code>npm run build</code>. Then "Deploy Site". Netlify
                  will produce a randomized URL for the site that should be
                  shared with all the team members. This is the link to your
                  "production" site. (You could even put this into the
                  <kbd>Readme.md</kbd> file to make it easy to find!)
                  <p class="callout">
                    The <kbd>build</kbd> version of the site will be considered
                    the production version. This should always work! The
                    instructor should be able to go to that address at any time
                    and not see any errors. Netlify will update your site
                    everytime it sees a change to the "main" branch. So after
                    pull requests are reviewed and merged you should probably go
                    check Netlify to make sure nothing broke.

                  middle initial. Then commit and push. What happened?

                      This should have resulted in an error with Git. There were
                      multiple changes made to the same file and Git doesn't
                      know which to keep! This results in a
                      <em>merge conflict</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>How can we avoid conflicts? A couple of ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        First make sure whenever you sit down to work on the
                        project you should <em>pull</em> before you do anything
                        else to make sure you get changes any of your teammates
                        have made recently.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Commit often! Small commits are less likely to result in
                        conflicts than large ones...and they are much easier to
                        fix if a conflict does occur.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Take advantage of software design techniques like
                        <a
                          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"
                          target="_blank"
                          >modules</a
                        >
                        to break your code up into smaller pieces.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Finally take advantage of Git's ability to
                        <em>branch</em>. See the stretch goals for more on that.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Before you can commit the merge conflict will need to be
                  resolved. Make sure that the <kbd>team.txt</kbd> file is open.
                  You should see some additions to the file from Git. It should
                  look something like below.
                  <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                      <img
                        src="../../images/330-merge-confilict.PNG"
                        alt="merge error from GitHub"
                      />
                    </figure>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    We must decide which code should be kept. The code under the
                    <code><<<<<< HEAD</code> is the code you were just trying to
                    send up. The code under the <code>=========</code> is the
                    code that was already in GitHub. If you want to keep the
                    code you were just writing, and throw the other away you
                    could choose "Accept Current Change". If you wanted to keep
                    what was on GitHub and remove your recent changes choose
                    "Accept Incoming Changes". Or if you choose "Accept Both
                    Changes" it will smoosh both sets of changes together. This
                    is often the quickest way to get rid of the conflict, but is
                    usually requires more work to actually fix the problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this case we should accept both, then delete the name
                    without the initial. That would leave us with the most
                    current versions of everything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once you fix the code you will need to <kbd>commit</kbd> the
                    merge...then you will be able to <kbd>push</kbd> your
                    changes to GitHub again.

                  <p class="callout">
                    This was a simple merge…easy to see what we needed to
                    keep…imagine if the file was 200-300 lines long, and two
                    team members had made edits in 10-15 lines of code scattered
                    across the file and caused a merge conflict! It would have
                    been far harder to figure out what to keep and what to
                    throw…KEEP your commits small!

              <p>Branching</p>
              <p>
                One of the most powerful features of Git is the ability to
                <em>branch</em> your code. Branching makes a copy of your code
                at the current point in time that you can make changes to
                without affecting any other branch! This allows an organization
                to always keep a fully working <em>production</em> version of
                their code that can be deployed at any time, and also work on
                adding features, fixing bugs, etc that often result in things
                breaking until they are done.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also use branches to reduce merge conflicts if multiple
                team members need to make changes to the same file in a
                codebase. Each team member should complete the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create a branch. Name your branch something like
                  <kbd>initials--branch_test</kbd>. (So for me the actual name
                  of the branch would be <kbd>st--branch_test</kbd>)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a file in the root of the project called
                  <kbd>yourname.txt</kbd>. Type your name in the file.
                </li>
                <li>Commit and publish (push) your branch to GitHub</li>
                <li>
                  Push your commit to GitHub...then do a pull after the other
                  members of the team have all pushed their branches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switch to one of the new branches in the repository. Notice
                  what happens to the listing of files in your editor when you
                  do. Switch back to your own branch. Switch back to the master
                  branch. Discuss with your team what you saw.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Throughout the semester you will be fixing bugs and adding
                  features to the SleepOutside site. When you assign a task to
                  yourself I would create a new branch to hold the work you will
                  do. Name the branch <kbd>initials--feature-name</kbd>. So if I
                  were going to work on the card dealing with the cart total not
                  calculating correctly, and my name were John Doe, I would make
                  a branch with a name something like
                  <kbd>jd--cart-total-calculation</kbd>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you are done with your work and you are confident
                  everything is working you should submit a pull request (see
                  below).
                </p>
              </div>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Pull requests</p>
              <p>
                When you are done with the feature that you created a branch
                for, the new code should be merged back into the master or main
                branch. This can be done in two ways...one is by directly
                merging the working branch back into the main branch, and the
                other is through a pull request.
              </p>
              <p>
                On projects where there is only one developer, merging directly
                works fine...but when working with a team it is more common to
                work through pull requests. A pull request essentially means "My
                work is done and tested, I am ready for the code to be merged in
                with the main branch. Can someone check it out and make sure you
                don't see any issues. (So I don't break anything :)"
              </p>
              <p>
                In our case right now, the branches do not contain anything
                important that needs to be merged back into the main branch. So
                most of them can just be deleted. Have one person however submit
                a pull request for their branch so we can see what the process
                is like.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the pull request has been made (you can do this through
                <a
                  href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr"
                  target="_blank"
                  >github.com</a
                >) the driver should go to the repository in GitHub and review
                the request and then finish the merge. Make sure that any extra
                branches are deleted once you are done merging.
              </p>
              <p>Move the card in Trello to "Done".</p>
