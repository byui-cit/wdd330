        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will review the tools introduced last week, and begin
          the process of making our application scalable by adding dynamically
          generated product detail pages, and more organization using ESModules.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity, do not look at the examples until your
          group has given that section a try. Then after you look at the
          example, resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to get
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team2: Dynamic product detail pages" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                GitHub before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team2</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team2</code>
              </p>

              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                We currently have one HTML file for each product we offer. This
                works okay when there are only 4 products, but we have plans to
                expand our inventory. We cannot continue with this model. The
                product pages all follow a similar template. There should be one
                HTML file that loads the details about the requested product
                through JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally as our code becomes more complex we will be well
                served by organizing it using ESModules.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our goal will be to eventually have a one to one relationship
                  with views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that
                  needs to be shared between modules can be placed in a utility
                  module.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will begin now by creating a module
                  (<kbd>productDetails.mjs</kbd>) to contain the code we will
                  need to dynamically produce our product detail pages.
                </li>

                <li>
                  It's very likely that other parts of our application will need
                  to make requests for product data. That functionality has
                  already been exposed in the <kbd>productData.mjs</kbd> module.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There will likely be other functionality that needs to be
                  shared between parts of the application, you should notice
                  that there is already a
                  <kbd>utils.mjs</kbd> module to hold those.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>product_pages/index.html</h3>
              <p>
                Instead of having an HTML file per product like we do currently,
                for scalability we would like one HTML file for all products
                that has some JavaScript in it to load the details. We need to
                create this HTML file. Open one of your current product pages in
                the editor, and file->Save As->
                <kbd>/product_pages/index.html</kbd>
              </p>
              <p>
                We also need to make some changes to the new file. We are going
                to dynamically insert the markup to display a product with
                Javascript so we need to remove the existing markup. We should
                however use that existing markup as a template, so instead of
                deleting it first remove all of the product specific
                information, and then copy it. You should leave the
                <kbd>section</kbd> element, we will need something to insert our
                dynamic markup into. It should look something like below:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">
  &lt;h3 id="productName"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;h2 class="divider" id="productNameWithoutBrand"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;img id="productImage" class="divider" src="" alt="" /&gt;
  &lt;p class="product-card__price" id="productFinalPrice"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="product__color" id="productColorName"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="product__description" id="productDescriptionHtmlSimple"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="product-detail__add"&gt;
    &lt;button id="addToCart" data-id=""&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
              </code></pre>
              <div class="callout">
                <h3>IMPORTANT!</h3>
                <p>
                  Make sure that you are working in the <kbd>src</kbd> directory
                  and NOT the <kbd>dist</kbd> directory! The build directory
                  will get erased and completely rebuilt each time you run
                  <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. Think of <kbd>dist</kbd> as the
                  production version of your code. <kbd>src</kbd> is your
                  working directory. You should not need to run
                  <kbd>npm run build</kbd> very often...like once a week after
                  you have merged some branches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you run <kbd>npm run start</kbd> it will use the files in
                  <kbd>src</kbd>.

              <h3>Review <kbd>productData.mjs</kbd></h3>
              <p>
                Open up the <kbd>productData.mjs</kbd> module file. Note a few
                things:
              </p>

                <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">function convertToJson(res) {
    if (res.ok) {
        return res.json();
    } else {
        throw new Error("Bad Response");
    }
}
    
export function getData(category = "tents") {
  return fetch(`../json/${category}.json`)
    .then(convertToJson)
    .then((data) => data);
}

export async function findProductById(id) {
  const products = await getData();
  return products.find((item) => item.Id === id);
}
                  </code></pre>
              </details>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Right now this module is quite small. Sometimes we will need
                  to get a list of all the data, sometimes we will only need the
                  data for one product. Keeping those functions separate lets us
                  only bring in what we need when we need it. Note that the
                  <code>convertToJson</code> function is NOT exported. We really
                  don't have a need to run that outside of the module.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will eventually want to use these functions for more than
                  just tents. We can do that by passing in the name of the
                  category of products we want to pull from into the
                  <code>getData</code> function. Note that it defaults to
                  <kbd>tents</kbd>, so if we pass in nothing when we use it
                  (like on line 16), we will automatically get tents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice the <code>getData()</code> function compared to the
                  <code>findProductById()</code> function. One uses just
                  promises and <code>.then()</code>, the other uses
                  <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"
                    target="_blank"
                    >async/await</a
                  >. Many find the async/await syntax to be easier to read (and
                  write) than the typical <code>.then()</code> based promise
                  handling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the syntax on line 12 <code>(data) => data</code> is
                  confusing you may want to spend more time reading about arrow
                  functions in JavaScript. You could re-write that short
                  callback function like this using a more traditional anonymous
                  function declaration:

                  <pre><code class="lang-js">function(data) { return data; }</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The callback on line 17 is similar...<code
                    >(item) => item.Id === id</code
                  >. Another way to write that could be:

                  <pre><code class="lang-js">function(item) { return item.Id === id; }</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    It is very common to see short functions that just return
                    some value or expression written using the arrow function
                    syntax.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  If you open up the <kbd>product.js</kbd> file you will see how
                  the <kbd>productData.mjs</kbd> module is used. First note that
                  we have to import the function we need, then we can use that
                  function just like if it were declared locally in that file.

                  <p class="callout">
                    Remember that to use ESModules in JavaScript we have to tell
                    the browser we want to use modules...we do that with
                    <code>type="module"</code> in the script tag in the HTML. If
                    you look at any of the HTML files in the
                    <kbd>product-pages</kbd> directory you will see that this
                    has already been added.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>URL Parameters</h3>
              <p>
                We need to have some way of passing in the product that we want
                to show the details for. A common way to do this is through a
                <a
                  href="https://www.sitepoint.com/get-url-parameters-with-javascript/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >URL Parameter</a
                >. If we create a link like this:
                <code
                  >&lt;a href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"
                  &gt;</code
                >. We have embedded the id of one of our products into the link.
                When the page loads it will have access to that information. If
                you read through that article it suggests the following lines of
                code to retrieve it:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const queryString = window.location.search;
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
const product = urlParams.get('product')
            </code></pre>
              <p>
                Use those lines to create a new function in the
                <kbd>utils.mjs</kbd> file called
                <code>getParam(param)</code> that we can use to get a parameter
                from the URL when we need to. (Don't forget to return the
                parameter!)
              </p>

              <p>
                Import your new function into <kdb>product.js</kdb>. Open
                <kbd>/index.html</kbd> and change the link to the first product
                page from
                <code>href="product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html"</code> to
                <code>href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"</code>.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Where did the <code>880RR</code> come from? If you look in the
                <kbd>json/tents.json</kbd> file you will see that each record in
                there has an id. <code>880RR</code> is the id for the first
                tent!
              </p>
              <p>
                Then test your getParams function in <kbd>product.js</kbd> to
                see if you can get the product id successfully when someone
                navigates to the product-details page. This would be a good time
                to test out our <code>findProductById</code> method as well.
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary>
                  Click for example code (<kbd>product.js</kbd>)

              </details>
              <p>
                You should also update the rest of the links in
                <kbd>/index.html</kbd> to match the first one. You can look up
                the IDs in the <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file.

              <h3>productDetails.mjs</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new file in the <kbd>js</kbd> folder called
                <kbd>productDetails.mjs</kbd>
              </p>
              <p>
                The <kbd>productDetails.mjs</kbd> module will be responsible for
                all of the functionality needed to lookup data for a specific
                product and display it in HTML. Good modules often follow a
                "black box" philosophy. The module should be very upfront about
                what it needs to function, but very opaque about the details of
                how it accomplishes it's work. This means in part that we should
                only expose as much as we need to for it to work. The following
                functions are recommended:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <code>productDetails(productId, selector)</code>: there are a
                  few things that need to happen before our module can be used.
                  This function will become the entrypoint into our module and
                  will make sure that everything happens in the right order.
                  This function should be the default export.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>addProductToCart()</code>: This is the function that is
                  currently in <kbd>product.js</kbd>. We need to move it here
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>productDetailsTemplate(product)</code>: this will insert
                  the product specifics into a string of markup.
                </li>

                <li>
                  You will also need somewhere to store the product data that we
                  will lookup. You can just declare a variable in the module
                  file for this.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                To use our module we need to pull everything from the last few
                steps together in the <kbd>product.js</kbd> file. Once we get
                everything refactored that file should look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import { getParam } from "./utils.mjs";
import productDetails from "./productDetails.mjs";

const productId = getParam("product");
productDetails(productId, ".product-detail");</code></pre>
              <p>
                Notice we import in the code we need from our modules. Then we
                get the id of our product using our helper function
                <code>getParams</code>. Then we use the function from
                productDetails with the productId to finish setting everything
                up.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

              <h3>Check Your Build</h3>
              <p>
                We just made some changes to the structure of our site. You
                probably don't realize it yet, but those changes actually broke
                the production version of the site. Let's take a look.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can check the production build locally. If you run
                <kbd>npm run build</kbd> it will update the files in the
                <kbd>dist</kbd> directory. You should do this periodically to
                check to make sure nothing is broken!
              </p>

              <p>
                Before moving on go ahead and run <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. We
                can get Vite to preview that build directory as well by adding a
                new command to our <kbd>package.json</kbd> file. Add the
                following: <code>"preview": "vite preview",</code> to the
                scripts section, then run it. Check to see what still works and
                what is broken. (You always need run
                <kbd>npm run build</kbd> before you run
                <kbd>npm run preview</kbd> after you have made any changes.)
              </p>
              <p>
                When we made the changes to the product details page, we forgot
                to update Vite so that it knew about the changes. Let's do that
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open up the <kbd>vite.config.js</kbd> file. Note the section
                that looks like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
build: {
  outDir: "../dist",
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      main: resolve(__dirname, "src/index.html"),
      cart: resolve(__dirname, "src/cart/index.html"),
      product1: resolve(
        __dirname,
        "src/product_pages/cedar-ridge-rimrock-2.html"
      ),
      product2: resolve(__dirname, "src/product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html"),
      product3: resolve(
        __dirname,
        "src/product_pages/northface-alpine-3.html"
      ),
      product4: resolve(
        __dirname,
        "src/product_pages/northface-talus-4.html"
      ),
    },
  },
},
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                We aren't using the specific product pages anymore, and instead
                have an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file that we need to let our
                bundler know about. Change that section so that it looks like
                this instead:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
build: {
  outDir: "../dist",
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      main: resolve(__dirname, "src/index.html"),
      cart: resolve(__dirname, "src/cart/index.html"),
      product: resolve(__dirname, "src/product_pages/index.html"
      ),
      
    },
  },
},
                </code></pre>
              <p>
                Anytime we add or remove more .HTML files to the site we will
                need to update this config or the production version of our site
                will break!
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to make one more build tool related change. If you look
                inside of the <kbd>dist</kbd> directory...you will notice that
                the <code>.json</code> files from the json folder are not there!
                Vite doesn't know it needs to copy them over. That means that on
                production the Product details page will not work since it
                relies on that file to look up the product information.
              </p>
              <p>
                The easiest way to fix this would be to create a new directory
                called <kbd>src/public</kbd>. Then move the
                <kbd>json</kbd> directory into that new folder. Vite will
                automatically copy everything in the <kbd>public</kbd> folder
                over to the build.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should move the <kbd>images</kbd> directory into the
                <kbd>public</kbd> directory as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Someone on the team should check the build periodically to make
                sure it is not broken. A good time to do this would be each time
                a pull request is merged!
              </p>

                  <code>productDetailsTemplate(product)</code>: The easiest way
                  to do this would be to use a template literal string ie:
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">
function productDetailsTemplate(product) {
    return `<p>${product.Name}</p>`;
}

                  <code>addProductToCart()</code>: move the code from
                  <kbd>product.js</kbd> for this function and make any changes
                  necessary to make it work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>productDetails()</code>: this function needs to do a few
                  things, copy/paste the following into your code to use as a
                  guide for finishing it:
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">export default async function productDetails(productId, selector) {
  // use findProductById to get the details for the current product. findProductById will return a promise! use await or .then() to process it
  // once we have the product details we can render out the HTML
  // add a listener to Add to Cart button
 
}</code></pre>

        <h2>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/v3.5-team2/src"
            target="_blank"

            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working, the driver should commit and
          push their changes (don't forget to lint and format your code before
          committing!), then submit a pull request for this branch. Then review
          the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back into
          Main. Finally, someone should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
