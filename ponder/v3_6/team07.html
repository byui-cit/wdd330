        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In the last activity we got our checkout working...barely. If the user
          does everything exactly the way you want the to the order will
          succeed. The user hardly ever does everything just how you want them
          to :) We need to harden up our code and add error handling and better
          validation.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team7: Error handling and Validation" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.

              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                GitHub before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team7</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team7</code>

              <h3>Figuring out what went wrong.</h3>
              <p>
                Currently if our order fails we get the very descriptive error
                message "Bad Request". Turns out that the server is actually
                sending back much more information than that, but we are
                throwing it away by how we are processing our response. We need
                to change this first.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open the <kbd>externalServices.mjs</kbd> module and take a look
                at the <code>convertToJson</code> function. It should look
                something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">async function convertToJson(res) {
  if (res.ok) {
    return res.json();
  } else {
    throw new Error('Bad Response');
  }
}
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                On line 1 we check our response to see if it is 'ok'. 'Ok' is
                any status of 200, or most 300s. If the status on the response
                is 40x or 50x then it is NOT okay. The server we are
                communicating with sends back a 400 response if something goes
                wrong. Then it puts the details in the body of the response. If
                we fail the okay test...we immediately throw an error with the
                message 'Bad Response'. What we need to do is get the detailed
                error message out of the response body.
              </p>
              <p>
                Refactor this function by converting our response body to JSON
                before we check if it's okay. Then if it is not okay then send
                the response body on in our <code>throw</code> statement.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  <code>throw new Error()</code> is a nice way to let the
                  application know that something went wrong. There is only one
                  problem with it in this case...Error() takes a simple string
                  as an argument. We can't send an object. There are a couple of
                  ways to get around this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, we could <kbd>stringify</kbd> the object. Second, we
                  could send a custom object back with our
                  <code>throw</code> instead of the default
                  <code>new Error()</code>. In this case the second makes more
                  sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An Error object normally has a <kbd>name</kbd> property and a
                  <kbd>message</kbd> property. Let's model our object after
                  this.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Change the line that looks like
                <code>throw new Error('Bad Response');</code> to something more
                like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">throw { name: 'servicesError', message: jsonResponse };</code></pre>
              The variable <code>jsonResponse</code> should be the body of the
              response from the server that we converted to JSON.
              <!-- END STEP -->

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Catching our Error</h3>
              <p>
                Throwing an error when something goes wrong does little good if
                we don't <kbd>catch</kbd> it somewhere and deal with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this case there are a couple of options for where to place
                our
                <code>catch</code>. We could place it in the
                <code>checkout</code> method that we wrote in the
                <kbd>externalServices</kbd> module, or we could place it in the
                <code>checkout</code> method of the <kbd>checkoutProcess</kbd>
                module. Discuss with your group for a few minutes the pros and
                cons of putting it in each place.
              </p>

              <p>
                Handling an error close to where it happened is usually a good
                thing, but we need to let the user know what they did wrong in
                this case. The form and form handling is in the
                <kbd>checkoutForm</kbd> component, and so in this case it makes
                sense to catch the error there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a <code>try { } catch(err) { }</code> block in
                <kbd>handleSubmit</kbd>. The part of the code that we are
                worried about breaking should go inside
                <code>try { // code here }</code>, and whatever you want to
                happen if the code in the try blows up should go in the
                <code>catch(err) { }</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Form validation</h3>
              <p>
                One of the things that the server will complain about is if any
                of the fields are missing information. HTML can actually do a
                really nice job of checking for that. All we need to do is add
                <code>required</code> as an attribute of an
                <code>input</code> element. If you did not do that in the last
                activity, add required to all of our form inputs. Then click the
                submit button.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on how you are listening for the form submission your
                HTML validation may or may not be working. If you attached a
                <code>click</code> listener on the button we will need to
                trigger the validation ourselves, if you listened for the
                <code>submit</code> event on the form the validation should
                automatically be working. Previously, we determined that since
                we were submitting our form through AJAX, we did not want the
                form to do what it normally would do if submitted. In the
                listener for the form button you have added
                <code>preventDefault</code>.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  If your HTML form validation is not working...do the following
                  in your listener handler function:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Get the form from the DOM.</li>
                  <li>
                    Forms have a method called <code>checkValidity</code> that
                    will return false if it finds anything in the form data that
                    goes against our validation rules. Call it and store the
                    result.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We can also manually trigger the messages that the browser
                    will add to the page when something is wrong. That is done
                    with <code>myForm.reportValidity()</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, if our validity test came back false, we do not
                    want to continue...so wrap the checkout process in an if
                    statement.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Your final code should look something like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="lang-js">function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var myForm = document.forms[0];
    var chk_status = myForm.checkValidity();
    myForm.reportValidity();
    if(chk_status) 
      // ...checkout code here.  Might make sense to pull this out into another function
});</code></pre>
              </div>
              <p>
                By leveraging the built in HTML validation that the browser can
                do, we dramatically reduced the amount of error handling we will
                need to do on our end!
              </p>
              <p>
                Thinking back to the reading from earlier (<a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation"

                  >MDN: Client side form validation</a
                >), what else should we add to our HTML validation to help our
                users to give us good input? Discuss this with your team and add
                those things you think appropriate.

              <h3>Handling the Unhappy Path :(</h3>
              <p>
                The next thing we need to do is to handle the errors the user
                might get. We want to stay on the checkout form page so the user
                does not lose what they have already entered...and so they can
                know what went wrong and fix it if possible. So a popup message
                would be appropriate here.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                When I say 'popup' here I am not referring to an
                <code>alert</code>. We want something much less intrusive that
                will not hijack the UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creating custom alert messages is something that could be useful
                outside of errors, so a new function in our utilities module
                sounds appropriate. Create and export a function called
                <kbd>alertMessage(message, scroll=true)</kbd> in
                <kbd>utils.js</kbd>. Create an alert component that matches the
                screenshot below. Insert your alert <em>before</em> the
                <kbd>main</kbd> element. Since the checkout form is longer than
                will fit on the screen of a mobile device, your alertMessage
                should have the option to scroll the page back to the top to
                make sure the user sees the error messages.

              <p>
                Currently our application does not give any feedback to the user
                about whether the order succeeded or failed. Let's start by
                responding to a successful order. We should probably do the
                following:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Give the user a success message</li>

              </ol>
              <p>
                This is not a very long list. The main decision to be made is
                how do we want to message the user? We could either pop
                something up in the current page, or take the user to a new page
                with a success message. Leaving them on the page with the form
                does not make a lot of sense...so let's move to a success page.

                header and footer, and then add a success message for the user.
                Then add the code to your checkout process to take the user to
                this page upon a successful checkout. Make sure to also clear
                out our cart contents in localStorage.

                When you add a product to the cart there is a good chance that
                the action gives no feedback to the user. If you have already
                fixed this and yours does give feedback...kudos! If not, we can
                use our alert to quickly send the user a message that the item
                was successfully added.
              </p>

        <h2>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/v3.6-team7/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally, someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
