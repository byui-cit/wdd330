        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the changes we have already made were to prepare the site to
          be able to scale up to as many products as we would like. In this
          activity we will add products organized from 4 categories: Tents,
          Sleeping Bags, Backpacks, and Hammocks. We will need to change the
          index page to show our four categories, and then build a dynamic
          product-list page that will pull the products from an API, and display
          them.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team5: Expand inventory" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read
                the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                GitHub before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team5</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team5</code>
              </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Refactor</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new directory in <kbd>src</kbd> called
                <kbd>product-list</kbd>, and create an
                <kbd>index.html</kbd> file in it. Also create a
                <kbd>product-list.js</kbd> file in the JS directory. Add the
                HTML to our new page to get the foundation up...header, footer,
                styles, etc. (Hint...you may just want to use src/index.html as
                a starting point. Then remove the banner and text.)
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                We just added a new page to the site. Remember to update your
                <kbd>vite.config.js</kbd> file to let Vite know about it or you
                will break the build!
              </p>
              <p>
                Move the JS from the <kbd>main.js</kbd> that is responsible to
                render our list of products to the new
                <kbd>product-list.js</kbd> file. Open up
                <kbd>product-list/index.html</kbd> in the browser to make sure
                the tents we had before are still rendered.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                You will need to fix some paths to get everything working
                correctly...your page will not be able to find the CSS file or
                the new JS file we made until you do. Do not worry about fixing
                the image URLs yet. Those will change again anyway and we will
                fix those later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally add a grid of 4 boxes to the src/index.html page, one
                for each category. They should look something like this:
              </p>

              <h3>Environment variables</h3>
              <p>
                We are about to change our application so that it communicates
                with an API server. This server will provide endpoints that we
                can hit to do things like pull product information, login users,
                submit orders, etc. While we are working we will be making many
                changes that we would not want to show up in a production
                environment. It would be nice then to have a test or development
                server we can use during development, where we can change
                anything we need without worry, and another production or server
                that has the real data that must be protected.
              </p>
              <p>
                This separation is very common in development. This means
                however that we are going to have to change the URL we use
                depending on whether our code is running in a development
                environment or a production environment. We could do this
                manually...but chances are that at some point you WILL send your
                development server URL to production at some point. That would
                be bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because this is a common problem a solution has been developed:
                Environment variables. Values that change automatically
                depending on where the code is running. Most of the time we
                create these in a file called <kbd>.env</kbd> (dotenv). We are
                using Vite as our build tool...it actually has the ability built
                in to work with these files. It will automatically look for a
                <kbd>.env</kbd> file and if it finds one it will make the
                variables defined therein available through a special global:
                <code>import.meta.env</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because Vite is for building frontend projects where all the
                code ends up in the browser, it gives us a way to control which
                of our environment variables become available in our client
                facing code. Any variable we want to use in the code we send out
                will need to be prefaced by <code>VITE_</code>. If you look in
                the <kbd>src</kbd> directory you will see a file named
                <kbd>.env.sample</kbd>, contained in that file is a variable we
                need defined:
                <code
                  >VITE_SERVER_URL=http://server-nodejs.cit.byui.edu:3000/</code
                >. This server URL is not something we need to keep secret, and
                it is something we need available in our code, and so it has the
                <code>VITE_</code> prefix. You will see how to use that in the
                next step.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open <kbd>.env.sample</kbd> and File-&gt;Save As just
                <kbd>.env</kbd> so that Vite will see it. NOTE! Each member of
                the team will need to do this!
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  You may be wondering why that file is called
                  <kbd>.env.sample</kbd>. Environment variables often contain
                  sensitive information in them and so it is common to not
                  include those files in the Git repo for the project. If you
                  take a look in the <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file that is part of
                  the project you will see in fact that we have already been
                  ignoring <code>.env</code> files. Files named that will never
                  be tracked by Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I wanted to give you an example of what the file needed to
                  look like however, and so sent a sample of it with a different
                  name. This is also a pretty common practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The next question you may have is: "well if the environment
                  variables do not get included in the repo...how do I get them
                  out to my production environment?" We will address that below.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                When our code gets deployed to Netlify (our production
                environment) It will need to know the server URL it should use.
                Since our <kbd>.env</kbd> file will not be part of the repo we
                have to set it a different way. Have someone in the team login
                to Netlify and pull up this project. Then goto "Site
                Settings-&gt;Environment Variables". Add a new variable. The key
                should be "VITE_SERVER_URL", and the value should be
                "https://wdd330-backend.onrender.com/". We will be using the
                same value in all contexts.

              <h3>Pulling from an API</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to modify our code to pull the product data from an
                API instead of from the local JSON file. Because of the way we
                have structured our code this should be fairly easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open up <kbd>productData.mjs</kbd>. In the
                <code>getData</code> function we use the category that is passed
                in to create a local path to the correct file. (up until now
                tents). The API we will be using is setup to allow the category
                to still work for us in this way, but the URL we need has
                changed. Add the following line to the top of the file:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const baseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL</code></pre>
              <p class="callout">
                Notice we are using the environment variable we set in the
                <kbd>.env</kbd> file!
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we need to use this new <code>baseURL</code> we just set to
                generate the complete path to the resource we need. While we are
                working in this function we should also take this opportunity to
                change our fetch to use async/await. Change the
                <code>getData</code> function to look like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">export async function getData(category) {
    const response = await fetch(baseURL + `products/search/${category}`);
    const data = await convertToJson(response);
    return data.Result;
}</code></pre>
              <p class="callout">
                Why <code>data.Result</code> at the end of that? It used to be
                simply <code>data</code>. The data sent back from the API is
                structured differently. We will have some other corrections to
                make because of this as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because we were already using the category to build a URL, we
                shouldn't have to make any other changes for this to continue
                working!
              </p>
              <p>
                You should now be seeing products listed if you click on one of
                the links, but there are two issues. The first is that no images
                are showing. The second is that all the links are showing the
                same list of products.

                <code>productList</code> module. Remember that we created a

              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  There are a few places we need to check to do this. We should
                  make a list:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Because we moved the product listing page into a directory
                    the URL listed in the template for a product card in
                    <kbd>product-list/index.html</kbd> will be wrong. That needs
                    to be fixed first.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We updated the
                    <code>getData</code> method to pull from the api instead of
                    the local file. Now we need to fix the
                    <code>findProductById</code> method. Before we did not have
                    the ability to request a specific product, we could only
                    request all products. The API we are using now has the
                    ability to query directly for this. The URL for the API
                    endpoint you need to hit is:
                    <kbd>baseURL + `product/${id}`</kbd>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once you get it working you will find that the image is
                    broken. We need to figure out why. See below for more on
                    this.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Fix the images</h3>
              <p>
                The data structure of our products changed slightly. This is why
                the images are broken. Analyze the data coming back from the API
                and figure out how to fix this issue. (You can use the
                <kbd>PrimaryMedium</kbd> image for the productList, and
                <kbd>PrimaryLarge</kbd> for the productDetail for now.)
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Fix the title</h3>
              <p>
                The title of the page currently says: Top Products. Add the
                category to that so that it looks like this: Top Products: Tents
                (if the tent category link was selected);
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

        <h2>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/v3.6-team5/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally, someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <p>
          After merging the pull request you should also check to make sure the
          production site on Netlify is still working!
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
